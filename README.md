# NineMansMorris

Produced by Haris Curic

Current version has two modes, single and two-player modes. 

Two player mode is a program that just enforces the rules of the Nine Mans Morris game while external players make the decisions about moves to play

Single player mode has one computer player that makes decisions based on 3 moves deep search tree, heuristic function for the leaf state nodes and minimax algorithm for decision making between actions. Current version is very inefficient and computer player is not very skilled, however, future improvements are coming soon. 

To run program, clone the repository and run "python main.py" from the terminal at the repository root. Program will ask you whether its a single or two player game. If single player game is chosen program asks you to choose which stones you want to play with (black or white). Then the game starts
